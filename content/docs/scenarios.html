<h2 id="scenariosandscripts">Scenarios and scripts</h2>
<p>To create scenarios, lighting effects or any other kind of automated script,
we can use the <em>Record Macro</em> functionality which is found in <em>Actions</em> menu
of the groups' page.</p>
<div class="media-container">

</div>
<p>When <strong>Record Macro</strong> option is active, every action taken (eg. controlling lights/switches
from the user interface or with a remote control), will be stored in a script
(namely a <em>Wizard Script</em>). 
By default, in the recorded script, it will be put <em>1 second delay</em> between each command.
We can switch between other kinds of timing while recording. One of these is called <em>Mimic</em>.
When Mimic is selected, the resulting script will replicate exactly the timing 
we used during the recording session.</p>
<p>To end a recording session and save the script, click the <em>Save</em> button in the bottom bar.</p>
<h2 id="wizardscripts">Wizard Scripts</h2>
<p>After saving the script the <em>Wizard Script</em> editor will open.
From there, we can further edit the script, add/remove commands, change the name,
the description and the program group.</p>
<p>A Wizard Script is a type of <strong>automation program</strong> that requires no programming knowledge
and it can be either automatically created from the <em>Record Macro</em> functionality,
as just discussed, or manually from the <em>Programs</em> page.</p>
<h3 id="performing">Performing</h3>
<p>There are different ways in which a script can be performed: </p>
<ul>
<li>it can be performed, for testing purpose, from inside the <em>program editor</em> by pressing the
<em>Run</em> option located in the <em>Actions</em> menu</li>
<li>it can be added to a <em>group</em> just as it happens with regular <em>modules</em>, in which
case it will appear as a button that can be pressed to run/stop it</li>
<li>it can be automatically performed when certain conditions occurs</li>
</ul>
